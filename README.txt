4. Contents of the main document: 1) Detection information: specific information about the oil spill detected by Sentinel-1 images in this study; 2）Train information：The Sentinel-1 images oil spill detection about training data set information in this study; 3) Model: deeplabv3+ source code used for oil spill detection in this study; 4) The Slove.py is the master model, you can use the code to train all model; 5) The SegDataFolder.py is to processing data. Which include channel data, mean and std. If you want to train new data, you should pay attention on the channel data and the value of mean and std; 6) The getSetting.py is to change the hyper-parameter such as optimizer, scheduler, criterion, backbone et.al.
